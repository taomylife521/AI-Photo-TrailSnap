> TrailSnap is an intelligent AI-powered photo album application that helps users effortlessly record, organize, and reminisce about their travel experiences. Through powerful AI processing capabilities, every photo and journey becomes a **treasured memory**.

> In the future, everyone (at least every family) will have their own AI data center, and the photo album is an important data source for this center. It preserves many moments from your life. TrailSnap is dedicated to transforming these moments into **valuable memories** — it can silently record train tickets and attraction tickets from your album, help you **record what you saw and heard during your travels**, automatically organize photos perfect for sharing on social media (even preparing the captions for you), and help you edit a 15-second short video······.

> Transforming travel from "just took photos" to "worth reminiscing, sharing, and cherishing." What TrailSnap aims to do is make every journey worth treasuring.

> That's why I named this project **"TrailSnap"** — where your data truly belongs to you.
