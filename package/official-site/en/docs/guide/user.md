# TrailSnap User Guide

Welcome to TrailSnap! This guide covers the main features and how to use them.

## 1. Quick Start

### Dashboard Overview
After logging in, you will see the system dashboard, which includes:
- **Data Overview**: Displays statistics such as total photos, albums, and footprint points.
- **Recent Memories**: Displays recently uploaded photos or activities in a timeline format.
- **Feature Shortcuts**: Quick access to albums, tickets, map footprints, and other features.

### Add External Library

1. Click "Settings -> External Libraries" in the navigation bar.
2. Enter the path of the external library (this is the Docker container path).
   - Example Docker mount: `/home/user/photos:/app/Photos/`
   - If you want to add the original folder `/home/user/photos/sea`, then add `/app/Photos/sea` in TrailSnap
   - If you want to add the whole `/home/user/photos` directory, then add `/app/Photos/`
3. Click Confirm, and the system will automatically scan all photos in that directory (task progress can be viewed in "Settings -> Task Management").
4. See [Directories](/en/docs/guide/settings/directories) for common issues.

### Map Service

If you want map features (view photos on map, edit custom scenic spots, etc.), make sure you configured your map provider in **Settings → Map Service**. See [Map Settings](/en/docs/guide/settings/mapsetting).

3. Click Confirm to create.

### Upload Photos

- **Map View**: Displays photo shooting locations on the map, lighting up your footprints.
- **Detail View**: Click on a photo to view the large image and detailed metadata (ISO, shutter, device model, etc.).

## 3. Smart Features

TrailSnap has built-in powerful AI services to provide you with the following intelligent experiences:

### Face Recognition & Clustering
- The system automatically analyzes uploaded photos and identifies faces.
- Automatically groups photos of the same person into "People Albums".
- You can name the identified people, and the system will automatically associate all photos of that person.

### Smart Search (OCR & Content Recognition)
- **Text Search**: Supports searching for text in photos (such as street signs, menus, text on tickets).
- **Semantic Search**: Search by directly describing the photo content, such as "sunset by the sea", "friends skiing", AI can understand your natural language description.

## 4. Itinerary & Tickets

This is a featured function of TrailSnap designed for travelers.

### Ticket Management
- **Automatic Recognition**: Upload photos of train tickets, flight tickets, scenic spot tickets, or concert tickets.
- **OCR Extraction**: The system automatically extracts key information from tickets (departure, destination, time, train/flight number, seat number, etc.).
- **Manual Entry**: If recognition is incorrect, manual modification or supplementation of information is supported.

### Itinerary Timeline
- The system automatically generates a complete "Travel Timeline" based on your ticket times and photo times.
- You can clearly see the complete trajectory from departure to return.

## 5. System Settings

On the settings page, you can configure the following:

- **Personal Information**: Modify avatar, nickname, password.
- **Theme Settings**: Switch between light/dark modes, or follow the system automatically.
- **Storage Settings**: View storage space usage.
- **Task Management**: View background task progress (such as ongoing AI recognition tasks, thumbnail generation tasks).
